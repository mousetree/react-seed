react-seed
===========

This is a template that I use for quickly creating new React apps with all the needed boilerplate - [roadmap](https://github.com/mousetree/react-seed/issues/1).

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
